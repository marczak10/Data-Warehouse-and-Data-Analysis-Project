## üèóÔ∏è Data Architecture

The data architecture for this project follows the Medallion Architecture with three distinct layers: **Bronze**, **Silver**, and **Gold**.

![Data Architecture](Data%20Warehouse/documents/data_architecture.png)

1. **Bronze Layer**  
   Stores raw data as-is from the source systems. Data is ingested from CSV files into a SQL Server database.
2. **Silver Layer**  
   Applies data cleansing, standardization, and normalization processes to refine data for analysis.
3. **Gold Layer**  
   Houses business-ready data, modeled into a star schema that is optimized for reporting and analytics.

## üìñ Project Overview

This project is divided into two main parts:

1. **Data Engineering**  
   Focused on designing and building a modern data warehouse to consolidate and process sales data.
2. **Data Analysis**  
   Concentrates on developing SQL-based reports and creating PowerBI dashboards that deliver actionable insights into customer behavior, product performance, and sales trends.

## üöÄ Project Parts

### 1) Building the Data Warehouse (Data Engineering)

#### Objective
Develop a modern data warehouse using SQL Server to integrate data from multiple source systems and enable robust analytical reporting.

#### Specifications
- **Data Sources:**  
  Import data from two primary source systems (ERP and CRM) provided as CSV files.
- **Data Quality:**  
  Implement data cleansing steps to resolve quality issues before analysis.
- **Integration:**  
  Merge data from both sources into a unified, user-friendly model.
- **Scope:**  
  Use the latest dataset only; historical data tracking is not required.
- **Documentation:**  
  Detail the data model, processes, and design decisions to support both technical teams and business stakeholders.

### 2) BI: Analytics & Reporting (Data Analysis)

#### Objective
Develop SQL queries and PowerBI dashboards to provide detailed insights and drive decision-making by analyzing:

- **Customer Behavior**
- **Product Performance**
- **Sales Trends**

These efforts help stakeholders access key business metrics and gain strategic insights.
